    ],
    "explanation": "Assignment rules can be used to assign ownership of a lead to either a person or a queue. You can set criteria to base these assignment decisions on. A lead can be created via a Web-to-Lead form, but it would not determine who the owner is. Web-to-Case would not be relevant because we are dealing with Leads and not Cases. Escalation Rules can change the ownership of Cases, but not Leads - and they are usually time-based and not immediate, as is implied with this particular request. Workflow Rules can be used to change ownership of a Lead, but this would not be the ideal method, because a new lead would first be assigned to the queue as the owner and then the workflow rule would change the owner to an individual. You would also have to create a separate workflow rule for each individual person that you wish to assign leads to and set the individualized criteria for each. Not ideal. A Lead Assignment Rule can have a multitude of conditions, and Salesforce will evaluate each until it finds a match."

Click Edit next to the desired picklist and confirm that the appropriate values are in the Selected Values column. You will need to do the same steps for each of the Opportunity Record Types to fulfill the requirements in this scenario. The Field Level Security only determines if a user can see and edit a field, but doesn't control which multi-select picklist values display to a user.

You would want to set the Org Wide Default on Accounts to Private, since the best-practice principles of the Security Model in Salesforce dictate that you start with the most restrictive settings, and then you open up further access and rights through Sharing Rules, for instance. You could technically ask one team to manually share with another, but this isn't the best option, when there is an automated way to accomplish this in the system by way of a sharing rule."

The Recycle Bin is where records go when they are deleted, but can't be used to perform actual record deletions. You can Mass Delete records via a List View, but this requires a custom JavaScript button and all of the records in the List View have to be of the same record type - this isn't supported in Lightning Experience, either, so deleting via List Views is not the best option, although there is technically a more involved way to accomplish this.

This feature allows users to find Closed/Won opportunities that match the attributes of an opportunity they're currently working on, so they can quickly access information that might help them close their open deals. Big Deal Alerts have to do with large opportunities and sending alerts related to them. You always want to avoid resorting to code, such as Apex Triggers, whenever something can be done declaratively on the platform (i.e. Clicks instead of Code), so asking a developer to write a trigger would be more time and cost intensive than simply enabling and configuring the Similar Opportunities feature. Workflow rules can't really pull in matching records. The Process Builder could perhaps fulfill this, but the myriad of possibilities would make creating it very complex. You could also potentially tie in a Flow with a Process to avoid resorting to code, but then again, that would be overly complex and time consuming as well. The main point of my ramblings is that you'll learn there are many ways to accomplish something on the Salesforce Platform. The key is learning which is the best option, given a scenario, and understanding the plusses and minuses of each approach.

Peace descends upon the Sales and Marketing departments and all is well in the world...until the Marketing Manager returns from a Tradeshow with a .csv file of 5000+ business card scans with contact details for new leads. You have been asked to import this long list of leads into Salesforce, but fear it will be rife with duplicates.

    "explanation": "There are two primary options available to you in Duplicate Rules to Alert and/or Report potential duplicates On Create and/or On Edit. An upsert combines creating new records and updating existing.The Alert option will warn users in the user interface of potential duplicates, but will add a row to the error.csv file when doing an insert, update or upsert from the Data Loader (i.e. when not using the interface). This effectively gives you the ability to match for duplicates beyond just email address into other fields that are specified in the Matching Rules contained in your Duplicate Rules on an object.The Alert setting is a way of allowing non-potential dupes to be inserted and updated and those flagged as potential dupes will go into an error file and not hit the system. You can then take the error .csv file to troubleshoot.For more fun and giggles with Duplicate Rules, you may be wondering about the Report option. What does that do? Glad you asked. It will help you with troubleshooting your rules - both Duplicate Rules and Matching Rules (which reside inside the Duplicate Rules) Report will create a record of any potential duplicates that are flagged by a Duplicate Rule. This will help you in troubleshooting your Duplicate Rules. But where are those records recorded? In Duplicate Record Sets. Duplicate Record Sets are available from the App Launcher and will display more details on which Duplicate Rule flagged potential duplicates and more details under Duplicate Record Items."

    "explanation": "History Tracking can be set on up to 20 fields per object. You can also track an additional 20 fields on Chatter, by the way (free tip). The Setup Audit Trail tracks who has been changed in your org from a customization standpoint and is not used for tracking changes to individual records. You can actually monitor users in the Debug Log for troubleshooting purposes, and it will reveal what records they are working on, but you have to guess which user, and the problem may be with a process or trigger that is causing these issues. You can also log in as another user and look at their Recently Viewed list, but this is also an inefficient approach. Stage is likely a field to already be tracked in most orgs, but I have been surprised by how many orgs have instituted no field history tracking. It's a quick win, when you are starting a new admin role to check for this.

You could customize the existing report, or clone it to create a new report off of the existing, and then add the additional filter criteria. To set the org-wide default to Private would have far reaching implications beyond just this single report, and is a good example of not introducing unintended consequences in your org in the quest to quickly provide a solution. You also would not want to resort to code (Visualforce page), when a declarative option (clicks instead of code) is readily available to you."

    "explanation": "Salesforce Flows provide a variety of automation options, each suited for different use cases. Record-Triggered Flows are best for background automation when a record is created or updated, but they do not involve user interaction. Screen Flows, on the other hand, are designed for guided user experiences, making them the ideal choice for step-by-step troubleshooting processes. Autolaunched Flows are useful for automation that does not require user input, such as background calculations or integrations. Lastly, Scheduled Flows execute at set intervals, making them suitable for time-based batch processing but not for real-time guided interactions. In this scenario, since the requirement involves guiding agents through a process interactively, a Screen Flow is the best solution."

    "explanation": "The Data Export functionality under Data Management supports the exporting of all data records inside of Salesforce as frequently as Weekly (this is Monthly in the free Developer accounts). Scheduled Reports can be scheduled, but this would be for only one object and would not encompass all Salesforce data. The Force.com IDE is a tool that can export metadata (in other words, the settings, configuration, code, etc. of a Salesforce instance) but cannot export the data records themselves. A common point of confusion is that of data vs. metadata. Consider metadata as those things you would administer and customize via the Setup menu in Salesforce, whereas data would be the individual records that are created by users from within the interface."
